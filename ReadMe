Hooks(
    1. UseState() ----> to change the variables simultaneously at diff places.
    syntax---> const[var , setVar] = useState(value);

    2. UseCallback() ----> If a func is used again and again by the trigger of some few dependencies the use this hook . it basically caches the entire function which help in optimisation.
    syntax-->useCallback(fn , dependencies);

    3. UseEffect() ---> use to sync with external code.
    syntax -- > useEffect( ()=>{} , [] )   it takes callback function and a dependency array

    4. useRef() ---> for reference
)
